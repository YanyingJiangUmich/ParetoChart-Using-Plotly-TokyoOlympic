    "The Pareto chart is a visual representation of the 80-20 rule by combining a bar + line chart. The 80-20 rule, also know as the Pareto Principle, is a widely seen phenomenon that people sometimes don't realize its existense.  It's named after Villefredo Pareto who found that approximately 80 percent of all wealth of Italian cities he researched was held by only 20 percent of the families. According to Wikipedia, the Pareto principle states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (Wikepedia, \"Pareto principle\", 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pareto Chart visualizes the Pareto Principle by displaying the ordered frequencies of categories (Count) along with the cumulative frequencies of categories (Cumulative Percentage). The lengths of the bars represent frequency, and are arranged with longest bars on the left and the shortest to the right, showing which situations are more significant. The line chart represents the cumulative frequencies of the values. A third line can be added to the graph as the \"80%\" line to help you quickly identify where the 80% locates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's also necessary to note that in the Pareto principle, the inputs and outputs do not have to add up to 100%. The relationship could as well be 80/40, 60/20, 90/30, or 100/10. The 80/20 distribution is just the most common one (Gulbis, 2016)."

    "Pareto chart is a great tool for decision-making. It can come in handy in the following circumstances:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have a list of rootcauses to a problem, and you want to determine where you should spend the most resources on. For example: Which software bugs cause the most crashes?\n",
    "2. You want to organize and sort the data by the categories' priorities\n",
    "3. You want to explore if the dataset follows the 80-20 rule \n",
    "4. You want to analyze data in business that you can count or measure: like Which customers attribute to most of your income or profit? Which products are the most popular and why? Which employees attribute to most company sales? (Gulbis, 2016) \n",
    "\n",
    "Pareto chart is commonly used in quality control analysis, to illustrate major of defect or problem in descending order of their frequency (number of times of occurrence) and their cumulative impact. It provides a better explanation regarding defects that are needed to be resolved first. One can also decide and plan about correct and important measures or actions that are needed to be taken regarding defect (GeeksforGeeks, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization technique also has some cons: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. It does not represent severity of defect or any problem since it only shows the frequencies. People may tend to ignore the problems that have lower frequencies while there is a chance these problem may cause larger losses. In other words, the pareto analysis makes people focus on the most significant ones and ignore the less significant one, leading to unfairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Parelo chart has limited use cases. When the dataset doesn't follow the 80-20 rule closely, it may not be very helpful for decision-making. Additional tools need to be explored.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pareto charts can only show qualitative data that can be observed. It merely shows the frequency of an attribute or measurement. One disadvantage of generating Pareto charts is that they cannot be used to calculate the average of the data, its variability or changes in the measured attribute over time (Wilhite, 2021).\n",

The visualization made from Plotly are beautiful and professional enough for business presentations and publications. It makes data exploration much more easier.
